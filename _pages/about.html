A group made by students, for students

The purpose of the UConn Plastic Surgery Interest Group (PSIG) is to act as the primary resource for all medical students seeking more information on this dynamic and rapidly changing field.


Our goal is to help all students navigate this multifaceted and competitive specialty, from students who are exploring a wide range of specialties to those who already have their sights set on a Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery residency. Accordingly, there is a variety of informational, surgical, and networking events students may attend. PSIG further aims to coordinate and foster connections between established medical professionals and medical students interested in this field. More specifically, students will have the opportunity to interact with surgeons and residents in the field and gain knowledge, mentorship, and research advice.
